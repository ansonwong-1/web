<h2>What is Eczema?</h2>
    <p>
        Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is an inflammatory skin condition. It is often characterized by a rash. Eczema tends to develop early during childhood and is a chronic condition that can have multiple flare-ups. According to <a>href="https://www.eczemaexposed.com/understanding-eczema#:~:text=The%20Inflammation%20Inside,is%20just%20waiting%20to%20happen."eczemaexposed.com</a>"Even when skin looks clear, inflammation is still active under the skin. The next flare-up is just waiting to happen."
