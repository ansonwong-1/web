<h2>What is Eczema?</h2>
    <p>
        Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is an inflammatory skin condition. It is often characterized by a rash. Eczema tends to develop early during childhood and is a chronic condition that can have multiple flare-ups. According to <a href="https://www.eczemaexposed.com/understanding-eczema#:~:text=The%20Inflammation%20Inside,is%20just%20waiting%20to%20happen.">eczemaexposed</a>,"Even when skin looks clear, inflammation is still active under the skin. The next flare-up is just waiting to happen."
    </p>
<h2>Symptoms</h2>
    <p>
        There are multiple types of eczema, but all share many similar symptoms. Most often, it starts as an itchy rash on the arms, especially behind the elbow, or on the legs, behind the knees. Other symptoms can include itchy, red, and scaly skin, hives, and fluid filled blisters. However, symptoms can widely vary among different people. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0091674999705361">sciencedirect</a> details the variations of symptoms throughout the world. 
    </p>
<h2>Treatments</h2>
    <p>
        There are multiple treatments, but no cure, for eczema. Treatments include topical steroids, topical antiseptics, and antihistamines. However, it's best to figure out your triggers and avoid them. For more information on treatments, visit <a href="https://nationaleczema.org/eczema/treatment/">nationaleczema.org</a>
